# assembler-in-C-code-for-mmn14

final project in "20465 System Programming Laboratory"  course at the Open University

This course gives fundamental knowledge and tools required for further studies in software development. As special emphasis is on portability, all exercises are tested in parallel on two operating systems. 
As the C language is strongly connected with the Unix family of operating systems, the laboratory uses Linux, a variant of this family.
By the end of the course, students will reach the level of experienced Linux users.
Topics: Principles of structured programming and C Universal principles of programming: abstraction, usage of data structures, building code from basic software blocks, using libraries, writing library functions, documentation, using modules, information hiding, developing machine independent software;
The Unix operating system  Linux system calls, using service programs and management tolls, writing new service routines.
